## Setting Up the Development Environment

After cloning the repository, create and activate a virtual environment, then install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

        Reason:
Excluding the venv directory from version control keeps the repository clean and avoids platform-specific issues. Using requirements.txt allows for clear documentation of the project's dependencies and easy recreation of the environment using pip install -r requirements.txt.
